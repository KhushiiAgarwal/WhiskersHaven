                    <h3>What differs us from one buying pets?</h3>
                    <h4>Buying a pet</h4>
                    <p>Buying a pet from a breeder can be a good way to add a pet to your family. You know how the pet will look as you will know about their parents beforehand. Buying a pet from a breeder will also mean that the pet will come socialized
                        and will be comfortable in your house. The pet comes with no previous experience so you can mould them the way you prefer. Good breeders also provide genetic testing of the pet which ensures that they will not develop any inherited
                        diseases later. But for buying a pet you will have to complete some legal procedure unlike adoption of pet.</p>
                    <h4>Adopting a pet</h4>
                    <p>Adopting not only gets a you a great companion, but you also save the life of the rescued pet by adopting it. Most shelter pets are adults and have their vaccinations up to date. Adopting is much cheaper compared to buying pets from
                        a breeder. Most of the pets in the shelter home have already had their basic training saving you the time to train them again. The shelter homes can also take the pet back if you find that it is not a good match for you. You need
                        to show more patience with adopted pets to bring them out of their shell and get them to gel with you.
