            Animals sometimes lose one or both parents. In such circumstances it`s unlikely that they will survive. Most orphaned animals will starve to death, die of dehydration, or be eaten by predators. The small number of orphans who do survive often undergo
            terrible hardships. For evolutionary reasons, most animals die shortly after coming into existence. It`s very difficult for very young animals to survive. Most new-born animals receive no parental care, which increases their risk of dying.
            But those who do receive parental care may be so dependent on it that losing it means almost certain death.

                    A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence and relatable
                    personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats; the technical term for a cat
                    lover is an ailurophile and a dog lover a cynophile. Other animals commonly kept include: rabbits; ferrets; pigs; rodents, such as gerbils, hamsters, chinchillas, rats, mice, and guinea pigs; avian pets, such as parrots, passerines
                    and fowls; reptile pets, such as turtles, alligators, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes; aquatic pets, such as fish, freshwater and saltwater snails, amphibians like frogs and salamanders; and arthropod pets, such as tarantulas and hermit
                    crabs. Small pets may be grouped together as pocket pets, while the equine and bovine group include the largest companion animals.
                </p>
                <p> Pets provide their owners (or "guardians")[1] both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and the dog with exercise, fresh air and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living
                    alone or elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved class of therapy animals, mostly dogs or cats, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals
                    or elders in nursing homes. Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive or emotional goals with patients.</p>
