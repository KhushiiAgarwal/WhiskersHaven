                            Your puppy needs a comfortable bed, so be sure to buy one that's big enough for it to grow into and stretch out in.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            There are many different types of bed for your puppy. Most puppies love snuggling into a piece of 'Vetbed' or similar. This is a synthetic simulated sheepskin, which is hygienic, machine washable, totally non-allergenic and relatively resistant to chewing.It
                            can also help to prevent pressure sores on bigger dogs. Buy two pieces so you use one while washing and drying the other.

                            You will need separate (non-slip) bowls for food and water. These should be raised up off the floor for tall dogs. Make sure fresh water is always available for your puppy.

                            Some dogs love having their own 'four-poster beds'. Many dog owners find these useful for containing their puppy and keeping them safe and out of trouble when they are alone, rather like putting a baby in a cot or play pen.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            When ordering a crate for your puppy, buy one big enough so that it can stretch out and stand up in when they are fully grown. Make sure that the mesh is not too big, as puppies may get their mouths caught. Put some bedding inside and tie some toys in
                            the far end of the crate so the puppy has to go in there to play with them. Gently place your puppy in there whenever they fall asleep.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            You can gradually increase the time the puppy stays in the crate, and initially this should be while you are still in the room with them.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>

                            Make sure your puppy has recently emptied their bladder and bowels before they settle in their crate and do not leave your puppy in the crate for more than a couple of hours during the daytime.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Never use the crate as a sin-bin or you will teach your puppy to resent it. Always remove the puppy's collar when in the crate in case it gets caught up on it.

                            Some short-coated or recently clipped dogs can really feel the cold, so they may benefit from wearing a fitted jumper or coat while out walking. Some long-haired dogs may benefit from protective clothing to keep them clean and dry in winter weather. Make
                            sure it fits properly and is well-tolerated by your puppy. Never make your puppy wear clothes indoors.

                            Choose a comfortable collar that is suitable for the breed, size and age of your puppy. Puppies grow rapidly and collars should be checked almost daily for condition and fit. These should not be so loose that they can slip over your puppy's head nor so
                            tight that you cannot slip two fingers underneath.

                            A dog should travel either behind a dog guard, secured with a car-seat harness or, ideally, in a crate or fixed car cage. A crate or cage gives a dog their own space and ensures both safety and comfort.

                            Help your puppy get accustomed to car travel by taking them out on short trips at first, ideally when they're tired enough to fall asleep. If the puppy is car sick, try fixing the crate on the back seat, as the car sways far more at the back which can
                            cause travel sickness.

                            You are required by law (under The Control of Dogs Order 1992) to inscribe the name and address of the owner on your dog's collar tag. You must comply with this, even if it is microchipped, and you can be fined up to £5,000 if you do not. You may also
                            want to put your telephone numbers on the tag, but you do not need to put your dog's name on it.

                            Choose a lead that is suitable for the size and breed of your puppy - not too long, too short or too heavy. A good rope lead is both strong and comfortable on your hands. Chain leads can be painful to hold onto, but may be useful if you have a puppy that
                            likes to chew or carry their lead in their mouth. Nylon leads are strong, but can hurt your hands. Whichever type you choose, make sure you attach it to the 'D ring' of the collar and not onto the split ring that attaches the
                            identity tag to the collar, as this is not strong enough to take the weight of your dog.

                            It is very important that your puppy has a range of appropriate and interesting toys to play with, otherwise they might chew on your things instead of their own. Chew toys also provide mental stimulation, help to keep your dog's teeth clean and allow
                            them to exercise their jaws. Select toys for your puppy carefully - some may be too small and might choke your puppy, while others may splinter.</p>

                        <p> Do not let your puppy play with sticks, golf or squash balls. All these things can easily get stuck in the throat and cause damage or even death.

                            There are lots of devices (mostly harnesses and head collars) that claim to help stop dogs from pulling on the lead. Some of these rub, squeeze or pinch the dog, and tend not to be tolerated well, so shop around and make sure that your puppy is comfortable
                            wearing it. You should allow your puppy enough time to become accustomed to any aid you ultimately choose. However, if you ensure correct training from the start, your puppy should not pull on the lead.

                            Short-coated dogs need to be groomed regularly, especially when they are moulting as their short hairs get can get stuck on everything! Use a rubber-toothed brush or a short-bristled brush, which massages the skin and works out the loose hair.

                            Breeds with medium to long coats or thick undercoats need gentle de-tangling every day to keep them knot free. The main problem areas that need the most attention tend to be behind the ears, between the toes, under the feet, in the armpits, the backs
                            of the legs and around the tail. Some dogs will need to have their beards or hair around their eyes cleaned regularly.

                            If you intend to exhibit your puppy in the show ring, they may need to have their coat trimmed into a special shape, or need hand-stripping or clipping. Your breeder, groomer, ringcraft class or breed club can advise you on the best way to achieve this.

                            Always brush your puppy slowly and gently. Gradually introduce the concept of grooming in very short sessions. If your puppy tries to bite the brush, put some taste deterrent on the brush so they learn not to bother.

                            Some dogs will need to have their nails trimmed if they get too long. If your dog has dew-claws (like little thumbs on the inside of its 'wrists') they should be checked frequently as these do not get worn down naturally and can grow in a circle and cut
                            into the flesh. You can learn to trim the nails yourself or have a vet or groomer do it for you.

                            Although your new cat can be fed on any ceramic or stainless steel bowls you have in your kitchen, you may feel better with providing her with her very own dishes. It is not recommended to use plastic dishes for cats, as some cats develop a chin rash
                            from plastic; also, softer plastic scratches, which provides a harbor from bacteria. There are a number of non-tip stainless steel bowls available for pets. If you prefer decorated ceramic dishes, make sure the glaze is lead-free.

                            Automatic food and water servers are especially nice if the humans will be gone for long periods during the day, e.g., to a job or school. Most cats love the pure, fresh taste of running water, and automatic water dispensers ensure a constant supply of
                            clean water.

                            All cats love to play, and your bonding time will begin by playing with Kitty and her toys. The "fishing pole, dangling lure" kind of toy is a big favorite for interactive play. Just make sure it is sturdy enough that small kittens won`t tear off feathers,
                            etc. from the dangling part. Catnip mice are a perennial favorite. Kitty houses and climbing posts can run the gamut from simple cardboard creations to custom built "cat furniture" combinations running several hundred dollars.

                            Grooming time is a fine time for bonding with your cat or new kitten. Look for a fine-toothed comb and a rubber-backed pin brush. A nail clipper designed for cats is a plus. If you start clipping your kitten`s nails early, it will make the task much easier
                            when she is grown.

                            This is a must. Don`t ever try to transport a cat without one. A simple cardboard carrier (available from your vet) is fine for bringing a new cat or kitten home, but you`ll need to replace this eventually with a solid-bottomed fiberglass or tough plastic
                            carrier with secure latch and a screened opening the cat can look through. A heavy-duty cloth airline-approved carrier is a good alternative if travel is in your future.

                            Your cat is going to scratch, whether you approve or not. Start your relationship off right by investing in a scratching post. It can be as simple or fancy as you like; you can even assemble one yourself if you`re handy with tools. Some commercially-made
                            scratching posts have catnip scent applied to attract your kitty. If your budget is limited, start with a cardboard scratcher, such as the Cosmic Alpine Scratcher.

                                Choosing the best litter box for your pet is an absolute must. Look for a sizable box with high sides for grown cats, as they tend to throw the litter around quite a bit. These can also be as simple or as extravagant as your pocketbook allows but start
                                with a basic plastic litter box for now placed correctly for your feline.

                                Kittens will need a box that`s low enough for them to enter easily. There are various kinds of litter, and the plant-based kind seems to be the safest. Clumping clay litter contains an ingredient that can harm cats if ingested, and all clay litters tend
                                to stir up dust, which is not healthy to breathe, either for you or your cat.

                                Consider a mat under the box to catch the stray litter. You can buy mats for that purpose at a pet store, or buy a few inexpensive carpet or linoleum samples that can just be tossed and replaced when they get too grungy.

                            There are a variety of clippers to choose from but most fall into the “guillotine” safety tool bucket, where the nail is inserted into a small opening and a slight squeeze cuts the tip. Cat claw scissors are also available, and they generally have blunted
                            ends to prevent cutting accidents for both pet and owner.

                            There are dozens of brush types to choose from. Some are designed to groom specific types of cats or to accomplish specific goals. The bristles on a cat brush can be hard, soft, wire or pin type. A slicker brush is a flat rectangular platform covered
                            with slender steel bristles. It can be used on all cat types and most cats love it. Cats groomed in the same place every day with this tool learn to seek for it and they practically beg to be brushed.

                            Combs are effective too. They are either fine-toothed (sometimes known as a flea comb) or wide tooth. It may be necessary to work slowly with a comb and sprinkle talcum powder to gently work hair mats out of a long-haired cat`s coat.

                            Since this is your first cat, he or she may likely sleep on your own bed, however, it`s still a good idea to provide kitty with her own special, cozy place for napping. The bed should be comfortable, easily washable and spacious enough for an adult cat
                            to curl up comfortably, but not so vast that she`ll feel exposed and vulnerable.

                            her home, should be at your local veterinary clinic. So make the appointment now, while you`re thinking about it.

                            or caking agent. Instead, go for Yesterday`s News recycled paper pellets to make sure that your rabbit won`t be harmed by your choice of litter.

                            Rabbits are especially keen on being able to eat hay while they poop. This is understandable since wild rabbits will mark their territory in a burrow with their droppings. To make sure that your rabbit is eating plenty of fresh, nutritious timothy hay,
                            install a hay feeder within mouth`s reach of their litter box.

                            so are inexpensive to run and don't heat the water.

                            rate that filters all the water in your tank at least four times each hour.

                            Each species of fish has an optimum temperature range to maintain health. Most fish require a temperature of about 74 to 77 degrees F. For aquariums over 40 gallons, it is a good idea to get two smaller heaters and put one at each end of the aquarium,
                            rather than one larger heater. This provides better distribution of heat throughout the aquarium. </p>
